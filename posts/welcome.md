Hello! This is my first post. I created this blog to document ML experiments, small projects, and random notes.

## Sample code

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

## Math example

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Block math:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}
$$
