Hello! This is my first post. I created this blog to document ML experiments, small projects, and random notes.

<!-- ## Why I Started This Blog -->

I wanted a place to share my thoughts on machine learning, document experiments, and write tutorials that might help others. This blog serves as both a learning tool for me and hopefully a resource for others interested in ML and development.

<!-- ## What You'll Find Here -->

You can expect to see content about:
- Machine learning experiments and research
- Programming tutorials and tips
- Project write-ups and case studies
- Random thoughts and observations

<!-- ## Sample Code -->

Here's a simple Python example:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

<!-- ## Math Examples -->

Inline math works great: $E = mc^2$

Block math equations also render beautifully:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}
$$

<!-- ## Future Posts -->

I'm planning to write about topics like neural networks, data visualization, and various programming techniques. Stay tuned!

Thanks for reading, and welcome to my blog!
